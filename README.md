# Sialk Language: The Sialk Programming Language

Serving as the first Persian and Arabic programming language, Sialk Language is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience, specifically tailored for users, students, and developers familiar with Persian or Arabic. Embracing the cultural and linguistic richness of the region, Sialk Language aims to empower a diverse range of individuals, making programming more approachable and fostering a sense of ease and collaboration in the local coding community.
